Pretend I wrote a beautiful metaphor describing Compnents, GameObjects, and Scenes here.

### W2
Describing RGB channels linearly as floats allow for a more expansive color range because there can be infinitely many intensities of color.

_bounce is a counter, so its values will only update incrementally. Floats are not necessary because there will be no decimal value. Boolean does not make sense because it does not convey the number of bounces. Strings are possible but require extra processing (turning it into an int to increment) so it is better to make it an int in the first place.

Step 4 did not have a semcolon and thus the compiler made a red squiggly underline with "; expected".
